This repo is a fork of liammclennan/JavaScript-Koans;

We just added the possibility to run it using `node` and `npm` or `yarn`

How do you run it using node:

Clone this project then run ```npm start```

This should open a browser and give you a nice live reload

For those using WallabyJS, just run it and you'll be on your way to master JS syntax
